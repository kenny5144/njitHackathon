# PennyWiseAI

## Inspiration
PennyWiseAI was inspired by the need for accessible financial literacy tools. Many individuals struggle to understand their credit scores and how to improve them. Our goal was to create a user-friendly application that leverages AI to demystify credit improvement strategies and provide personalized guidance.

## What it does
PennyWiseAI allows users to upload their credit reports and receive tailored suggestions for improving their credit scores. By analyzing the uploaded data, the application offers actionable steps, helping users understand their financial health better and make informed decisions.

## How we built it
We built PennyWiseAI using a combination of technologies:
- **Frontend**: Next.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express to handle API requests and authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user information and profiles.
- **File Handling**: Utilized Multer for managing file uploads.
- **AI Integration**: Employed OpenAI to generate personalized credit improvement suggestions.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we faced several challenges:
- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring user data, especially sensitive information in credit reports, was handled securely.
- **API Integration**: Integrating the AI model and ensuring it returned accurate suggestions based on diverse user data.
- **User Experience**: Designing a user-friendly interface that effectively communicates complex financial information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
